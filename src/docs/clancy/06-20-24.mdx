On May 29th, 2024 - five days after the release of Clancy, the band put up for sale a limited, digital edition of the album named "Clancy - Digital Remains" which contained an exclusive 121-page booklet featuring "never-before-seen alternate artwork, handwritten lyrics, rare photographs and personal artifacts from the album's creation". The digital album remained available for sale on the band's store website until May 31st.

At first moment, nothing seemed out of ordinary about the artwork featured on the booklet. Meanwhile, as the first half of June went by, fans wondered why the music video for the song "Paladin Strait", set to release during "early june", was not premiered yet. It was not until June 18th that Discord user @originalWasteland found out that the booklet pages could be overlaid and connected with each other, creating a puzzle.

On June 20th, as fans grouped together to find more connections and solve the puzzle, the Blurryface account on X/Twitter replied to user @KEONSEAST, who was livestreaming the colletive building of the puzzle a day before, with "ISA W" ("I SAW").
