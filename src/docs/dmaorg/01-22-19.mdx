[![Alt text: Scan of typed journal page. Handwritten signature reading 'Clancy' at bottom.](./assets/17-35.4527.jpg)](./assets/17-35.4527.jpg)

**File name:**  17-35.4527.jpg

**Additional Info:**

- The date (January 22nd 2019) is the date of this update.
- The letter was posted on the same day as the Chlorine music video
- The file name references the scientific properties of chlorine. Chlorine has the atomic number 17 and has an atomic mass of 35.4527.
- Underneath the image, there is a “<.” This is presumably part of the Ned emoji that Tyler has created. [<{•.•}>].
- Some of the letters in the journal are doubled (two of the same letters on top of each other)  and together spell "sodeepnedbayou.” This references the “we are banditos” audio, specifically how it is said forward to achieve the phrase backwards, but written out with actual words. However, it should be noted that Tyler does not say the phrase this way at the shows, as shown in Episode Two of the Bandito Tour series on YouTube, nor does this pronunciation give the most accurate recreation of the phrase.
- The journal file was updated twice to correct its grammar (that -> than, happened -> happen). The changes can be arranged to spell `NED`, the name of the character in the Chlorine music video.
- The date for this journal appears twice, as text on the page itself above the image as well as in the image itself.

**Transcription of the letter:**
> “I can't face this page for long enough to write what I'm truly feeling. I am only wrought with more que<b>s</b>tions: Questions about what I assumed to be true, questions about what my <b>o</b>wn path is, and the question that has plagued me every night that I lie here, back in city: Di<b>d</b> I give up?
>
> The force I saw between him and his bishop seemed t<b>e</b>nse to me, and frightening. But the memory of that exchange has had time to fester and replay in my mind long enough that I'm qu<b>e</b>stioning if I even remembered it correctly. I assumed the bisho<b>p</b> was forcefully retrieving his subject, but I now wonder if the bishop was actually trying to save him, and he refused.
>
> I stayed out there for five days after I watched it happened. I haven't seen him since. Maybe he got away, and was still out in Trench with me. Maybe the bishop chased him dow<b>n</b>, and brought him home.
>
> Home?
>
> Did I just call this place 'home?'
>
> After all of the endless beauty that I saw out th<b>e</b>re, am I now convincing myself that I'm actually better off within these confines?
>
> I admit, It was more difficult that I expecte<b>d</b>. Nothing could have prepared me for how much the 'unknown' can consume me. Vast landscapes and endless possibilities, yet coupled with endless danger. I became anxious. I became tired. I <b>b</b>ecame hungry. every step I took became harder than the last, jumping from jagged rocky step to step, or pulling myself through thick forest - it all became debilitating, and I was sure that I couldn't go on.
>
> Keons approached <b>a</b>s the sun rose one morning. I wasn't scared. I was relieved. After all that he had taught me, his presence was the most comforting moment that I had in da<b>y</b>s, and I couldn't help but be happy to see him. In true Keons fashion, he wrapped his arms around me, then put his hands under my face, looked me in the eyes, and said 'Clancy, child, let's go home.'
>
> I've been here for a few weeks n<b>o</b>w, and while the routines of this world are comforting, and certainly easier than life out there, my mind keeps bouncing between the two places.
>
> Which one is home? Are the bishops protecting me, and the torches <b>u</b>pon the hilltops dangerous? Or is it the other way around? My dreams pull me from world to world, and I feel lost in between all of it.
>
> There is still so much I do not understand."
