This update correlates to the fifth eye tweet, from “Kitchen Sink”: “Nobody dreams when they blink.”

**File name:** i.gif

**Additional Info:**
- The gif shows a cinereous vulture blinking and turning its head, as something calls its attention.

## 018 07MOON 01 – July 1st - Day of the update

[![Alt text: Scan of a typed journal entry. The lines of the journal page seem to have been cut up and shifted in a pattern. At the bottom is the handwritten signature of Clancy.](./assets/_e_sr__eve_r_.jpg)](./assets/_e_sr__eve_r_.jpg)

**File name:** _e_sr__eve_r_.jpg

**Additional Info:**

- The lines from this journal were stripped and put together to spell a hidden message, visible only with the yellow tape image available in the same update.

- The yellow tape highlights the message “WE ARE BANDITOS” vertically, in reference to the audio file found in [http://dmaorg.info/found/2018_514_3_8/clancy.html](http://dmaorg.info/found/2018_514_3_8/clancy.html). As the file name suggests, you need to “reverse” the audio to hear the message.

 ![A lifeless light surrounds us each night. Never could I imagine that something so luminous could feel so dark. It's this glow that reminds us of the dreamless existence we've been sentenced to. But what I call a sentence, others accept as normalcy. How did they so efficiently eradicate the dreams within us? When the bishops instituted Vialism as mandate, they effectively reversed the hope that many arrived with. Am I the only one who realizes that we've been lied to? Am I the only one not afraid of the notion that the nine have hijacked our trust, and extinguished the hope that once motivated our existence? We used to close our eyes and picture a better life, now this city is full of dry eyes caught in a trance of obedience, devoid of any trace of an identity. The only significant light I've seen has been in the eyes of those smeared - such a curious sight, to see bright eyes strangled by the darkness of bishop hands. As their penance fades, so dims their memory of something more. My hope of something more is all I have in this rigid tomb, and I will not let it die](./assets/alttext.png)
