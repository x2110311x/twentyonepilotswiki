# 04/20/18 - Vessel gif changed

The [gif/video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IigZXFhkbMM) used on the [Vessel tab](https://store.twentyonepilots.com/vessel.html) of the twenty one pilots store site was replaced with one containing an incomplete link: [https://dmaorg.info/found/⁙_./clancy.html](https://dmaorg.info/found/15398642_14/clancy.html). This corresponds to the first eye tweeted before the hiatus: “You’ll have to come and find me.”

[![Alt text: Gif with various scenes from Vessel music videos and behind the scenes videos, including Holding On To You, House of Gold, and Car Radio. Clip at end of gif shows tv screen from Car Radio music video with a link hidden in the TV static/ glitch.](./assets/vesselstorepage.gif)](./assets/vesselstorepage.gif)
