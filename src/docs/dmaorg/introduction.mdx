## What is dmaorg.info?

[dmaorg.info](http://dmaorg.info) is a website domain officially created and hosted by the band Twenty One Pilots and used mainly as an online conceptual teaser for their 2018 album TRENCH. It featured a cryptic background story and important lore information referenced in the songs and music videos of the TRENCH era.

The domain was first discovered by the fanbase on April 21st 2018, during the band’s hiatus between Blurryface and Trench through a link hidden inside the Twenty One Pilots’ official merch store website. The original link led to an exclusive 404 error page, telling the viewer “they’re in violation” and “no one should know about this” while showing a violation code.

When pasted correctly into the URL of the website, the violation code granted access to a [subdomain](http://www.dmaorg.info/found/15398642_14/clancy.html) of dmaorg.info containing journals and images telling the story of Clancy, an afflicted fictional character living inside a circular city loomed by huge walls and ruled by nine bishops – the Sacred Municipality of Dema.

As the website updated throughout months and more content was added to its lore, Clancy’s struggles with Dema became visible and a plan to escape the city came true. But after getting lost in the unknown wilderness of Trench, Clancy grew weary and anxious, ending up being retrieved back to Dema by his bishop Keons and temporarily ending the timeline of dmaorg.info.

As of its latest update in April 5th 2021, all files in the subdomain were deleted and the website showed up an “Account Terminated” message instead, teasing the next era of the band's projects.
