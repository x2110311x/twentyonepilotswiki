At around 3PM Eastern Time, dmaorg.info received its first update since the fifth journal entry was added in January 2019 (the "Chlorine" update).

The entire website now showed up through a filter that inverts all colors displayed on the page - white now appeared as black and vice-versa. The majority of the image files remained essentially intact, although three of them actually had its original colors inverted: the map (*_ti_su_p.png*), the Tyler photo (*2_1_2.gif*) and the black journal (*he_a_vy.jpg*). Because of the filter, these three images would show up “normally” on the page. 

[![Alt text: Inverted image of the original map of Dema. Light gray map with top left corner torn off. In center of map is a circular area with lines of small concentric rectangles inside labeled necropolis. Inside that is a dark circle labeled Limit and Glorious Vista. Inside that are 9 districts arranged in a circle, each labeled with a name that corresponds to a dot in the center. At very center of map are 9 dots arranged in a square. Each dot has a name written above it.](./assets/_ti_su_p-inverted.png)](./assets/_ti_su_p-inverted.png)

[![Alt text: Inverted version of original image. Note: original version of the photo looked like it was already inverted, so this version looks normal by being inverted twice. Picture of a torn piece of paper with a halftone image on it lying on a stone like background. Halftone image shows a Tyler lying in a shallow stream next to rocks. The way he is lying makes him appear to be almost dead. Because of the angle, only the lower half of his body is visible and not his face. A cliff can be seen in the background. Tyler is wearing black pants and a lighter colored shirt with black boots. This is the same setting and outfit as the Jumpsuit music video.](./assets/2_1_2_inverted.gif)](./assets/2_1_2_inverted.gif)

[![Alt text: Inverted version of original image. White text on black background. The text is typed and at the bottom is the signature of clancy. There are several small white squares at the bottom left and top right of the page. Transcription of note available on page for 7/01/2018 - Black Journal added.](./assets/_he_a_vy_-inverted.png)](./assets/_he_a_vy_-inverted.png)

A progress bar was added to the top of the page, showing the progress of “//Terminating Files.”

[![Alt text: Screen shot of partially filled grey progress bar. Text above says "Terminating files. heavy.jpg"](./assets/terminatingfiles.png)](./assets/terminatingfiles.png)

Above the loading progress bar, after “*//Terminating Files…*”, various files names would be typed out and then erased continuously, ranging from actual file names contained inside the dmaorg website to randomly generated strings of letters and numbers followed by a file format.

The progress bar would also repeatedly load itself, then stop and restart as it reached a certain percentage - which would increase steadily as the time passed and change every time the page was refreshed. Its time of conclusion was determined by a constant value inside the script of the website - 259,200 seconds, equal to 3 days. Therefore, the loading bar was programmed to fill up completely on Monday, April 5th at 3PM Eastern Time.

There is also one significant update to one of the files contained previously on the page:

## 017 02MOON 12

**File name:** _.jpg


**Additional info:**

- While the name of the file did not change nor did the MOON date above it, the color of the tape (previously a bright yellow) has been altered. It would now show up on the inverted website as a dark shade of blue, while the original image seems to be of a pale red tape.
- The red and blue have been noted to be similar to the shades used for the [Regional At Best](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Twenty_One_Pilots_logo.svg) era band logo.
